## What was new and where am I trying to apply?

- On a more technical level, "Jest" and adding "Docker" to the project were completely new points for me.
- Trying to apply and think about design patterns, SOLID principle and Clean Code was also something new.

- I tried to apply dependency injection. But first try to also apply the singleton pattern which at the end I decided not to use.
